## Much My Lawn
Deployed link: https://munchmylawn.herokuapp.com/ <br />

Connect with local goats in your area and interview them to see if they are the right match to munch your lawn/garden/bramble.

### A Learning Experiment
This project was put together by Gabe Jon and Kobe in order to learn new technologies such as SASS and Socket.io. We got together for the last project at General Assembly Seattle, and since we had previously chatted about a goat munching app, it took off from there. Using a Token Authorization system, our app allows clients to sign up and chat one on one with goats in the area while skipping the middle man; the farmer. If satisfied or dissastisfied, we have implemented a review system to track goat efficiency.

### Technologies used
  * Socket.io
